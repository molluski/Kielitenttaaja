# Kielitenttaaja (The language Griller)
With 'Language Griller' you can study by rehearsing the wanted words. First the words and their translations are being fed for the app. After that it gives you a random word from the list with the chosen language. You must give the translation, and the app will tell wether the ansver is correct or not.

For now the app is in the stage of taking the words in and being able to give a random word. The function to compare the words is on the process.
